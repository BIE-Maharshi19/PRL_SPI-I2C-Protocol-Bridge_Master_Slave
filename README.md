# PRL_SPI-I2C-Protocol-Bridge_Master_Slave
1) Developed Verilog-based generic communication protocols for FPGA based processing electronics in Neutral Ion and Mass
Spectrometer (NIMS). Focused on SPI, I2C and AMBA-APB based Master programming for developing feature specific
protocols to integrate various sub-systems of NIMS with timming and clock synchronization.

2) Implemented novel APB-to-SPI and vice-versa for cross-protocol communication.
